      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to AAHAR, a community-driven platform that connects donors with
        NGOs to combat hunger and reduce food waste. Our mission is to
        facilitate the donation of surplus food, enabling individuals and
        businesses to easily contribute to those in need. Through seamless
        coordination with dedicated NGOs, we ensure that every meal serves its
        purpose, nourishing the needy and fostering a culture of sustainability.
        Join us in creating a world where generosity meets action, transforming
        surplus into support and making a tangible difference in the fight
        against hunger.
