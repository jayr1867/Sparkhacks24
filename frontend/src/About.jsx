      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to AAHAR (आहार), meaning food in Hindi and Sanskrit, a
        community-driven platform that connects donors with NGOs to combat
        hunger and reduce food waste. Our mission is to facilitate the donation
        of surplus food, enabling individuals and businesses to easily
        contribute to those in need. Through seamless coordination with
        dedicated NGOs, we ensure that every meal serves its purpose, nourishing
        the needy and fostering a culture of sustainability. Join us in creating
        a world where generosity meets action, transforming surplus into support
        and making a tangible difference in the fight against hunger. Embrace
        the spirit of AAHAR, where every contribution is a step towards a better
        tomorrow.
